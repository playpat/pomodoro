## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Basic Workflow:
1. Work for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro)
2. Take a 5-minute break
3. After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer 15-minute break
4. Repeat the cycle
